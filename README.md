# sneeky-bot
Discord bot developed in node.js

A first attempt at creating a node.js-based application.
It provides the heart of a functioning discord bot created via discord, 
containing functionality such as:
  - text manipulation
  - resource uploading/downloading
  - casino minigame, featuring currency

The project is currently discontinued, as I believe the architecture is inefficient and could definitely be re-written
using better practices with my newly gained node.js knowledge.
